## YouTube Chat Bot

This is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to chat on YouTube videos using CharGPT API. The bot works by extracting the transcript of the video you are watching and using it to generate responses to your questions.

### Quick Start

To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Download the extension files from the repository
2. Fill the `GPT_KEY` field with your own chatGPT key in `js/popup.js`
3. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable Developer mode (toggle switch in the top right corner)
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files

### Usage

Once the extension is installed, navigate to a YouTube video and click on the extension icon to open the chat window. The extension will automatically extract the transcript of the video and use it to generate responses to your messages.

To send a message to the bot, simply type your message into the input box and press "Send". The bot will respond with a message generated based on the transcript of the video.
